broken arrow shocked face muttering im whats scarier term find disappointing broken arrow graham yosts wrote speed surprise eh script bad script simply takes chances yost content write similar speed john woo work magic surprises excitement time script places actors predictable situations respond situations expect actors realize theyre film rehash act im expecting script throw surprises suppose dont alright script flaws film suspension disbelief factor runs bit high expected believe things nuclear blast underground effect surface nuke light dragged stairs person military doesnt monitor deal nuclear weapons closely past things suspend disbelief pretty average movie goer harder time makes film work things working john woos ability direct action scene men im direction flawless mind films pacing jumping frantically scene scene times suddenly slowing apparent reason easy forgive woo scene simple shootout mine mesmerizing watching men jump cover cover blasting sight switching slow motion realtime movement poetic scenes fear adequately working films favor enjoyable score hans zimmer gladiator quaint bit wrote plays time travolta appears screen broken arrow run bit long minutes easily chopped id recommend film love woos style direction travoltas style overacting graham yosts style reusing script give movie half stars past reviews found catch movie hits misses pretty bad risk enjoy
