um science und von fiktion kann gleich gar nicht die rede sein contact ist auch kein actionbrueller der alle dreissig sekunden einen lacher und alle drei minuten eine nukleare explosion bietet contact weckt mich wenn passiert hiess ein langer thread einer englischsprachigen newsgruppe dennoch oder vielleicht sogar deshalb ist contact einer der besten filme des jahres wie reagiert eine welt die ploetzlich erfahren muss dass sie nicht die einzig leben spendende im universum ist wir wissen aus geschichtsbuechern welche verwerfungen die wissenschaftlichen revolutionen der vergangenheit durch kopernikus galilei darwin und einstein ausgeloest haben und heute contact zeigt die verwurstung eines epochemachenden ereignisses durch die medienmaschinerie der gegenwart schrille schlagzeilen wichtelnde tvreporter fade late night witzchen hohles politikergeschwaetz massenhysterie kommerzialisierung muehelos gelingt es das wichtigste ereignis der menschheitsgeschichte auf alltaegliches normalmass zurechtzustutzen fuer die medien ist der kontakt zur wega zuerst ein quotenrenner es erscheint passend wenn cnn einer der hauptdarsteller des films geworden ist die politiker denken reflexhaft die auswirkungen auf ihre wiederwahl die profis den hinterzimmern managen die situation routiniert und effizient wie eine beliebige krise auf dem aktienmarkt oder im schlafzimmer des praesidenten und auch die wissenschaftler sind heute im showbusiness taetig springen behende auf die neuste durchs dorf gejagte sau auf der jagd nach foerdermitteln und persoenlichem ruhm realistisch und bissig zeichnet contact ein bild dieser unserer welt der eine besessene junge wissenschaftlerin und ein spleeniger multimilliardaer die einzigen normalen menschen zu sein scheinen contact ist die verfilmung eines romans des verstorbenen wissenschaftlers carl sagan der den er jahren zu den beredtesten propheten eines universellen weltbildes gehoerte er war das vorbild zu jener figur spielbergs close encounters die von dem franzoesischen regisseur francois truffaut gespielt wurde sagan vermittelte seinen fans das kindliche staunen das er beim blick ins empfand dieses staunen versucht auch der film bei uns auszuloesen eine schwierige aufgabe einer zeit der die kinogaenger brennende galaxien und warpfaehige raumgleiter gewohnt sind jodie foster ist eine wissenschaftlerin die im nach sich selbst sucht nach der wahrheit nach dem sinn des lebens altmodischer kram von dem wir uns heute meist erfolgreich abzulenken wissen und gelegentlich kann man hoeren dass diese wahrheitssuche eigentlich die suche nach gott ist ist jodie fosters junge astronomin auch eine der wenigen spirituellen gestalten des films obwohl ihr atheismus und die ehrliche antwort auf die gretchenfrage sie beinahe die erfuellung der kindheitstraeume kosten die verwirklichen sich schliesslich den weiten des alls doch die reise der menschheit ist damit noch keineswegs zu ende es ergeben sich mehr fragen als antworten und ende ist wieder alles eine sache des glaubens geworden denn der film bietet keine jener beliebten hollywoodloesungen die doch kaum bis vor die tuer des kinos tragen diesen schwierigen stoff einen spannenden film verwandelt zu haben ist keine geringe leistung contact ist ehrgeizig und meist erfolgreich die schwaechen des films werden bei weitem von seinen staerken aufgewogen contact muss kompromisse schliessen zwischen jenen die gerne noch etwas mehr die komplexe thematik eingestiegen waeren und jenen die vor allem kurzweilig unterhalten sein wollen sind brueche der handlung unvermeidbar und obwohl die realitaet ihr haessliches haupt sehr deutlich erheben darf ist der film im detail nicht realistischer als independence day robert zemeckis ist auch
