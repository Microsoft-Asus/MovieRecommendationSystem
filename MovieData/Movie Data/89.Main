minuten fsk ab jahren der geschftsreisende gene watson kehrt gerade von der beerdigung seiner fast geschiedenen frau aus san diego zurck und bahnhof eigentlich nur kurz ein telefonat fhren bevor er mit seiner kleinen tochter weiterfhrt dummerweise wird er von dem killerprchen smith und ms jones kennen wir das nicht irgendwoher auserkoren die gouverneurin eleanor grant zu erschieen whrend sie einem groen hotel verschiedene reden halten wird er bekommt eine waffe und das versprechen seine tochter werde knapp minuten tot sein wenn er seinen auftrag nicht ausgefhrt hat gene versucht sich die polizei zu wenden doch jeder scheint der verschwrung beteiligt zu sein und die uhr tickt wer schonmal ein fertiggericht der mikrowelle aufgewrmt hat wei wie lange eine minute dauern kann wer gegen die zeit gesehen hat der wird sich wundern wie schnell minuten vorbergehen knnen denn regieveteran john badham saturday night fever drop zone hat einen fast schon unmenschlich spannenden echtzeithriller depp glnzt als junger verzweifelter vater denn selbst wenn er mit seinen kargen dialogen nicht viel aus seiner figur machen kann ist es seine ausstrahlung die ihn zur perfekten identifikationsfigur macht den besten part hat allerdings christopher walken abbekommen denn gegen die zeit spielt er nicht nur einfach den perfekten allwissenden killer sondern hat mit den gleichen schwierigkeiten zu kmpfen wie sein opfer als da wren menschenmengen funkstrungen und gewissen bedrfnissen nach einem drink das macht ihn nicht nur menschlicher sondern verleiht dem film auch echte spannung wie man sie nur selten erlebt denn hier kann man sich wirklich fragen wei der killer bescheid hat ers gesehen knackpunkt film ist natrlich seine den haaren herbeigezogene story die sich keinen sinn macht ihre abgedrehtheit aber vollends ausspielt denn regisseur badham wei wie er aus den kurzen aber knackigen hhepunkten seines film meisten macht mit schwindelerregenden zeitlupen mehrfachen kamerafahrten seine hauptdarsteller heran und vorrausdeutungen im dutzendpack gelingt es ihm spielend den zuschauer von den bohrenden fragen nach dem warum abzulenken und das mu ein film erstmal schaffen das finale ist zwar etwas vorraussehbar geworden trotzdem ein wrdiger abschlu fr einen unterschtzten film hochspannender echtzeitthriller mit netten ideen und ansprechenden darstellern visit movieguide german
