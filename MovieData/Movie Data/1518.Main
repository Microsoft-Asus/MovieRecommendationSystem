red barr jt walsh amy taylor kathleen quinlan earl mc gainey billy jack noseworthy geregisseerd door jonathan mostow geschreven door jonathan mostow en sam montgomery speeltijd minuten iedereen kent wel het gouden ei dat bekende boek van tim krabbi het gaat een nederlands echtpaar dat door frankrijk rijdt de benzine van hun auto raakt op en dus stoppen ze bij een benzinestation de vrouw besluit wat bij het winkeltje te halen maar ze komt niet meer terug haar echtgenoot wordt radeloos en onderneemt een grote zoektocht totzover het gouden ei de amerikaanse film breakdown heeft dezelfde opbouw als dit boek en als je dacht dat het gouden ei spannend dan heb je deze film nog niet gezien jeff kurt russell en amy taylor kathleen quinlan vormen een doodgewoon echtpaar dat door de woestijn rijdt om zo san diego te komen onderweg valt de auto stil maar gelukkig stopt er een vrachtwagen ze maken kennis met de vrachtwagenchauffeur die zich voorstelt als red barr jt walsh na een paar discussies besluit amy met barr naar belles diner te gaan een restaurant waar zij een sleepwagenbedrijf kan bellen jeff gaat hiermee akkoord en blijft alleen achter al snel wordt jeff het wachten beu en gaat zelf aan zn auto sleutelen na enige tijd weet hij zn wagen weer te starten en rijdt daarna met volle moed naar belles diner waar hij amy verwacht helaas ze daar niet sterker nog de barkeeper heeft zn vrouw niet binnen zien lopen jeff begrijpt er niets van en gaat verder op zoek nadat hij aan de barkeeper gevraagd heeft om naar zn vrouw uit te kijken met minder moed stapt hij de auto jeff verkent de dorre gebieden van de woestijn en ontdekt de verte een vrachtwagen die er precies hetzelfde uitziet als de wagen van red barr enigszins kwaad laat hij de vrachtwagen stoppen met een paar rauwe rijtechnieken jeff heeft gelijk het inderdaad de wagen van red barr barr stapt georriteerd uit de wagen maar hij herkent jeff niet ook beweert hij amy nooit meegenomen te hebben jeff nu hopeloos en heeft geen idee hoe hij ooit nog zn vrouw terug kan zien ongelooflijk mensen met een zwak hart moeten deze film absoluut niet zien breakdown bloedstollend jonathan mostow regisseur en schrijver van deze film haalt alle mogelijke middelen uit de kast om de suspense en de spanning tot ongekende hoogten te voeren de prachtig beeld gebrachte verlaten landschappen dragen daar een steentje aan bij net zoals de bijna voelbare spanning belles diner en de schne de bank breakdown vervalt gelukkig niet clichis en kent zelfs een originele schurk die na het moorden en stelen er nog een gezin aan overhoudt zijn relatie met vrouw en kind wordt goed uitgewerkt ook zijn er veel verrassende plotwendingen zodat je je niet snel verveelt en russell als de wanhopige echtgenoot weer topvorm dat het meer dan een jaar duurt voordat deze film eindelijk nederland te zien niet te begrijpen breakdown kun je zonder meer fantastisch noemen ik heb er van de allereerste schne tot de allerlaatste minuut van genoten ein ding zeker na deze film denk je wel twee keer na voordat je met een vreemdeling meerijdt martijn van turnhout
