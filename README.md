Project for Neural Networks Class

We developed a movie recommendation system using Self-Organizing Maps (SOM). Used SOMs to classify over 1450 movies using parameters such as genre and plot keywords.
Experimented with various techinques to calculate similarity for prediction such as Euclidean distance, Cosine distance and Dot Product.
While the accuracy of the final results was not very good compared to the state of the art the algorithm showed promise if applied on larger datasets and better test data.
